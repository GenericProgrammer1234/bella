# Bella programming language

![Bella language logo](assets/Bella-language.png)

Bella is a simple functional programming language, written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run). Still very much a work-in-progress. ðŸš§

## Using Bella

There might be a way to have a binary in the future, but for now you will need:

- Gleam
- Node.js _(This is Gleam's target runtime)_
- This repo

Then you can try out the [examples](/examples/):

```sh
gleam run ./examples/hello_world.bella
```
