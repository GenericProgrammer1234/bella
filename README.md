![Bella language logo](assets/Bella-language.png)

Bella is a simple functional programming language, written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run). Still very much a work-in-progress. ðŸš§

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add bella_lang
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/bella_lang>.
